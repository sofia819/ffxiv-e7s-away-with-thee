## Inspiration

I made this to understand the `Away With Thee` mechanic (teleport mechanic) in E7/S, because I am really bad at it.

## Goal

Make an app to simulate how the mechanic works. The teleport direction is relative to your character's orientation.

## How to use

[Link to App](http://sofia819.github.io/ffxiv-e7s-away-with-thee)

- Click on `Change teleport direction` to change the direction of the debuff given.
- Click on `Change player orientation` to change where your character is facing.

## Notes

- Obviously, this is written in a very short amount of time, so this is not polished at all and looks ugly.
- My original goal was to implement the entire arena to explain the first DPS tether/laser mechanic in E7S, but that is quite complicated, so I decided to not do that.
